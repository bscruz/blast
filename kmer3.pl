# an associative array (a hash) where each key is one distinct k-mer in the string,
# and the associated value is the last starting position where that
# k-mer is found. For example, if the input is ACACTCA and k is 2, then
# one key is AC with  value 3; another key is CA with value 6;
# another key is CT with value 4; and one key is TC with value 5.
